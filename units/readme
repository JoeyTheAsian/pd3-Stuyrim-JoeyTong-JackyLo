Notes/ToDo:
-figure out item implementation in player
-tweak stats
-figure out volcano boss
-fix luk and speed
   -luk should be critical rate (0 - 50%)
   -speed should be movement, not evasion (max = 25?)
-included a lot of accessor and mutator methods for all(?) of the variables in the unit classes
-attack is HACKNSLASH
